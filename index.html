                    <p> Hello! My name is Geoffrey Jiang, currently staying in the Bay Area and a student at UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp! Before this I graduated with a Health Science degree from Merritt College and worked as an EMT. As you may have figured out by now, I have little to no experience with coding. I also recently learned I am not hip with modern technology as I am always amazed with what new technology can do! I chose this to take on coding because it was time for me to move on from the medical field, growing as tired as i was from working there. Coding has offered me a step into a whole different direction from what i am used to and i'm excited to see where it will take me!</p>
